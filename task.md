#### Prompt 2. 
I'm looking for an innovative and sustainable AI-driven side hustle that generates consistent daily or monthly income, even if it's a modest amount.

While I acknowledge the potential in AI-generated content (e.g., subtitles, AI images, short videos for marketing or personal use), I'm specifically seeking an idea that moves beyond these prevalent content creation methods.

My ideal idea should:

Be unique or specialized: Something that isn't already saturated with AI content creators.

Offer a clear value proposition: How does it solve a problem or provide a distinct benefit using AI?

Require minimal ongoing effort for consistent income: The goal is a steady stream of income without demanding a significant time commitment, complementing a full-time job.

Be feasible for an individual to implement: Avoid ideas that require extensive teams, large capital investment, or highly specialized AI development skills (unless leveraging existing accessible AI tools).

Focus on recurring revenue potential: How can this idea be structured to bring in income regularly, rather than one-off payments?

Please propose one specific, actionable idea that fits these criteria, along with a brief explanation of how AI would be leveraged and the potential for consistent income.
