#### Result
Here are 10 unique digital product ideas in unsaturated niches that are profitable and beginner-friendly:  

### **1. AI-Powered Custom Workout Plans**  
**Why Profitable:** Fitness enthusiasts want personalized plans without hiring a coach. AI tools can generate tailored workouts based on goals, equipment, and fitness levels.  
**How to Start:** Use no-code tools like Bubble or Zapier to connect AI (like OpenAI) with a simple web app. Offer free samples, then charge for premium plans.  

### **2. Niche Legal Document Templates (e.g., for Indie Hackers, Content Creators)**  
**Why Profitable:** Most legal templates online are generic. Customized contracts (e.g., for freelancers, YouTubers, or small SaaS businesses) sell well.  
**How to Start:** Partner with a freelance lawyer to draft templates, then sell them via Gumroad or a simple Shopify store.  

### **3. Interactive Learning Quizzes for Obscure Skills**  
**Why Profitable:** People love gamified learning, but most quizzes are for general knowledge. Target niche skills (e.g., "Bonsai Care Quiz" or "Crypto Tax Quiz").  
**How to Start:** Use Typeform or Interact to create quizzes, monetize via lead magnets or paid access.  

### **4. Done-For-You "Micro SaaS" Setup Service**  
**Why Profitable:** Many solopreneurs want simple SaaS tools (e.g., a habit tracker or lead gen form) but don’t know how to build them.  
**How to Start:** Use no-code tools (Softr, Glide) to create basic apps, then sell them as one-time purchases or subscriptions.  

### **5. Digital "Fix-It" Guides for Rare Tech Problems**  
**Why Profitable:** People Google obscure tech issues (e.g., "Fix Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Drift") but often find no clear solutions.  
**How to Start:** Research forums for unanswered questions, create step-by-step video/pdf guides, and sell on Payhip.  

### **6. Customized Notion & Obsidian Templates for Small Professions**  
**Why Profitable:** Notion templates are popular, but most target generic productivity. Niche templates (e.g., "Veterinarian Patient Tracker") have less competition.  
**How to Start:** Design in Notion, export as templates, and sell via Twitter/Reddit communities.  

### **7. AI-Generated Niche Audio Content (e.g., Sleep Stories for ADHD)**  
**Why Profitable:** Audio apps like Calm are huge, but few target specific audiences (e.g., "ASMR for Programmers"). AI voice tools make production easy.  
**How to Start:** Use ElevenLabs for AI voiceovers, sell on Etsy or a subscription site.  

### **8. "Hidden Feature" Tutorials for Popular Software**  
**Why Profitable:** Many users don’t know advanced features in tools like Excel, Photoshop, or Figma. Short, hyper-specific tutorials sell well.  
**How to Start:** Screen-record quick tips, bundle them into a Gumroad product, and promote on niche forums.  

### **9. Digital "Side Hustle" Kits for Unusual Niches**  
**Why Profitable:** People want side income but are tired of dropshipping/print-on-demand guides. Kits like "How to Sell Plant Clippings Online" stand out.  
**How to Start:** Research untapped hustles, compile step-by-step PDFs + resources, sell via TikTok ads.  

### **10. Automated "Mini-Courses" for Hyper-Specific Tasks**  
**Why Profitable:** People prefer bite-sized learning (e.g., "How to Brew Kombucha at Home" vs. a full cooking course). AI can auto-generate these.  
**How to Start:** Use ChatGPT + Canva to create 10-page PDF courses, sell on Etsy or via Pinterest ads.  

### **Key Advantages of These Ideas:**  
✅ **Low Competition** – Targeting micro-niches avoids oversaturation.  
✅ **Beginner-Friendly** – Most require no coding, just content creation + simple tools.  
✅ **Scalable** – Many can be automated or turned into subscriptions.  

Would you like me to refine any of these further based on a specific skill set you have?
